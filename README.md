##Introduction

Welcome to my DevOps Projects repository. I aspire to document my journey in DevOps/Cloud as I adventure to learn a good foundational understanding of all the tools and concepts.

This learning journey towards DevOps started for me early 2023 when I was actively looking for an external attachment as required by my institution of learning. And that was when I came across Oaknet Business (Engineering and Technology) and after a series of interviews and chowcasing how passionate I am to learn, they offered me an opportunity to concentrate my efforts around DevOps and the community surrounding these technologies. Oaknet Business was admittedly the best choice because they offer Software, Big Data, Smart Data Centres, Control Rooms, Internet Of Things among other Technological Services to prestigious clients and I only saw it fit to accept the opportunity. 

I have a long journey ahead of me for the next 90 days that will cover the following areas of DevOps:
