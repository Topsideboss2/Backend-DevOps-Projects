# DevOps Projects

## Introduction

This is my **DevOps** projects repository that is meant to help you easily interpret and understand these simple projects. 
Following an internship opportunity at **Oaknet Business** where they offer Technological Solutions for all types of clients, I was able to implement these projects and learn a lot from the team.
I hope the following steps outlined will help you navigate and implement these projects.
My wish to you is that you will be able to learn as much as possible from this repository just as much as I did from my colleagues and in turn assist others.

One thing I came to appreciate during my time as a DevOps intern was that documenting is a huge part of working in the field. The sooner one starts to document the steps taken to deploy a project, the better it'll help them in the long run.

## What Is A Laravel Application?

Laravel is a free and open-source PHP framework that comes with tools and resources that help you build robust and modern web applications and provides all of the features you need as a back-end developer such as routing, validation, caching, queues, file storage and more.
