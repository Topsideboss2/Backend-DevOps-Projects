## What is RSYNC

Rsync is a Linux-based tool that can be used to sync files between remote and local servers.

The purpose of creating a mirror of your Web Server with Rsync is if your main web server fails, your backup server can take over to reduce downtime of your website. This way of creating a web server backup is very good and effective for small and medium size web businesses.
